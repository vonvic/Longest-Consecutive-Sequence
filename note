maintain a list of sequences
iterate through every element in the list
    update sequence list
    when to update?
    for each sequence that begins in B and ends in E with length L
      formatted as (B, E, L)
        if number X == B-1, then update B = X and ++L
        if number X == E+1, then update E = X and ++L
        if number B < X < E, then update ++L
        
    else (X is not inserted in a sequence)
        insert X in sequence
          formatted as (X, X, 1)
